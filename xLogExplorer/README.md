#  xLogExplorer

Small program to query the MacLoggerDX database. I run MacLoggerDX in a 
separate space, usually not visible, when running WSJT-X and SmartSDR on
the iMac. For 6 meters I am looking for new grids so rather than always 
switching spaces and having to check if I have worked that grid and have
a QSL I can stay on my WSJT-X space and do a quick query.
